Goal: create a java program that iterates through a set of numbers and prints even numbers

Methodology: I used a for loop to iterate the variable "i" from 1-10. After that, it uses an if statement to check if i divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 (meaning the number was even). If it was even, it was printed to the console.
